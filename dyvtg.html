	THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR

		Packing
 		 The table tries not to allocate huge chunks of screen real estate if
 		 you ask it for a lot of rows and columns.  You can always stretch out
  		the frame or explicitly tell it how big it can be.  If you want to
 		 stretch the table, remember to pack it with fill both and expand on,
 		 or with grid, give it -sticky news and configure the grid row and column
  		for some weighting.</p></h4></pre>

<p><h4><pre>

		Array   
 			 The array elements for the table are of the form array(2,3) etc.  Make
  			sure there are no spaces around the ','.  Negative indices are allowed.
	
		Editing
  			If you can't edit, remember that the focus model in tk is explicit, so
 			 you need to click on the table or give it the focus command.  Just
 			 having a selected cell is not the same thing as being able to edit.
  			You also need the editing cursor.  If you can't get the cursor, make
  			sure that you actually have a variable assigned to the table, and that
 			 the "state" of the cell is not disabled.

		COMMENTS, BUGS, etc.

		* Please can you send comments and bug reports to the current maintainer
 		 and their best will be done to address them.  A mailing list for
  		tktable discussion is tktable-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

		* If you find a bug, a short piece of Tcl that exercises it would be very
  		useful, or even better, compile with debugging and specify where it
  		crashed in that short piece of Tcl.  Use the SourceForge site to check
  		for known bugs or submit new ones.</p></h4></pre>
